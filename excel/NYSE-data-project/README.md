# Project Description
I analyzed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I worked with a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle, that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.
The project is divided into three parts:
1. Calculating business metrics and summary statistics, creating visuals and communicating business insights.
2. Creating a dynamic Profit & Loss (P&L) statement for each company.
3. Creating a financial forecasting model to present future growth prospects for the companies.
