In this SQL project, I assisted the team of a Digital Music Store with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and invoice information. 

I formulated four business questions and wrote the queries to pull the data needed to answer those questions. Then, I built the visualizations in Excel with the results from the queries, and presented the business insights. The queries were run in SQLite.

In this folder, you will find a JPG file named "Music-store-database" that contains the database schema of the music store, and a SQL file that includes each of the queries used to find the data and create the visualizations.

Here is the link to access the PDF file with the visualizations and business insights: [SQL Project - Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwwq6zckSlHPJQlGCe_dueC9EeN7GUFH/view?usp=sharing)
