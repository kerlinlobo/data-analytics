In this project, I wrote scripts in SQLite to explore and analyze the product portfolio, customers, and employeesâ€™ performance, and created visualizations to effectively communicate business insights for revenue generation strategies. 

This folder includes a JPG file named "Music-store-database" that contains the database schema of the music store, and a SQL file that includes each of the queries used to find the data and create the visualizations.

Here is the link to access the PDF file with the visualizations and business insights: [SQL Project - Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwwq6zckSlHPJQlGCe_dueC9EeN7GUFH/view?usp=sharing)
